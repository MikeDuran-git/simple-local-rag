Anabolic French Toast
Anabolic French Toast is a Coach Greg classic! Enjoy this delicious high protein version of a North American 
classic breakfast. It is recommended to pair the anabolic french toast with fresh fruit or your favorite low-
calorie syrup (such as Walden Farms).
Directions
1.
In a bowl, add egg whites, sweetener, cinnamon, and vanilla
extract. Whisk until spices are evenly distributed throughout
the mixture.
2.
Heat a griddle over low-medium heat. Spray griddle with
cooking spray.
3.
Dip bread slices into egg white mixture, and transfer to pan.
4.
Spoon any leftover egg white mixture on to the bread in the
pan. If done slowly, the bread should absorb the mixture and

Let cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side.
6.
Remove French toast from the pan and serve on a plate with
toppings. Suggestions for toppings are fresh fruit and low-
calorie syrup.

French Toast 
Blueberry Pancakes
Directions
1.
In a blender, add bread slices, egg whites, guar/xantham gum,
sweetener, and cinnamon.
2.
Blend on high until mixture is uniform in consistency. Remove mix
from the blender and add to a fridge-safe airtight container.
3.
(OPTIONAL): Let sit for 2-3 hours or more in the refrigerator. The
longer you let the mixture rest, the better it binds. (Note: it can be
cooked right away but it’s better if it has time to sit).
4.
Heat a griddle over low-medium heat. Spray griddle with cooking
spray. Add mixture to griddle and let sit for 1-2 minutes until
edges appear cooked through.
5.
Add blueberries to the pancake in the griddle.
6.
Once edges start to brown and pancake appears to be visibly
cooked about ⅔ of the way, flip the pancake in the griddle and let
sit another 1-2 minutes.
7.
Remove pancake from the griddle and serve on a plate with low-
calorie syrup or leftover blueberries.

Coach Greg: “I normally do not like fish in a wrap, but I actually love these! And they help me get in my 
healthy omega-3 fats from the salmon. I don’t even like sushi in a restaurant and I like these!! So if you think 
you don’t like fish, give this a try and see for yourself. I also mix up my tortillas based on whether or not I’m

Cheesy Grilled Egg White 
French Toast Sandwich
Who doesn’t love French Toast? And who doesn’t love grilled cheese and egg 
sandwiches? Well, I decided to combine these two American classic breakfast recipes and 
make them into an explosion of anabolic deliciousness. Once you try this recipe, it will 
become part of your every day meal rotation. And that’s a guarantee!
Directions
1.
Heat a non-stick pan over medium/low heat. Spray with cooking
spray for one second.
2.
Pour egg mixture on pan.
3.
Place bread slices on the pan for 15 seconds then flip.
4.
Cook for a few minutes until the egg mixture is cooked. You can
cover the pan to cook evenly or flip egg whites while cooking until
desired readiness.
5.
Fold the egg mixture onto the bread slices and place a slice of
cheese on top of each slice (add salt & pepper if desired)
6.
Place bread slices on top of each other, allowing the cheese to
melt inside the sandwich.
7.
Turn off the heat, and place the sandwich onto a plate. Eat
immediately with a fork with no sugar-added ketchup if desired.
THIS IS ONE SITUATION WHERE YOU NEED TO PICK THE FORK
UP!!

Powdered Peanut Butter and Jam 
Sandwich on Protein Bread
If you grew up eating peanut butter & jelly sandwiches like most of us, you will love this modified version 
that will help to support your gains! With substitutions of powdered peanut butter and protein bread 
instead of full-fat peanut butter and normal bread, you will be able to eat a higher volume of food every 
day while adhering to your diet.
Directions
1.
Toast bread slices in the toaster until they have a light brown crisp.
2.
Mix powdered peanut butter in a bowl with 1 tbsp water (or more
or less depending on desired thickness), and stir until an even
consistency is achieved.
3.
Spread powdered peanut butter mixture on the bread slices. Then
add low-calorie jam. Eat as a closed sandwich or as two open face
sides, whichever you prefer. Enjoy!

Protein Bar
Directions
1. Microwave IMO syrup in a bowl until bubbles start to form (about 
1 minute on high).
2. Remove bowl from microwave and add remaining ingredients. 
Combine all the ingredients together with a mixer or spoon until 
you achieve a sticky, doughy consistency.
3. Spread mixture onto a silicone tray and transfer to a freezer. Pro 
Tip: To help transfer the gooey mixture, Greg recommends that 
you spray one of your fingers with cooking spray to help to evenly 
distribute across the tray.
4. After about 1 hour in the freezer, remove the tray and let sit at 
room temperature for 5 minutes. Slice the batch into portion sizes 
of choice (for reference on the nutrition by portion size, see the 
nutrition table). Wrap individual pieces in wax paper and return 
them to the freezer.
5. Chocolate bars should remain in the freezer until they are ready 
to be eaten. Eat within 5 minutes of removing from the freezer for 
best results.

Special K Banana Crunch
 Chocolate Protein Bar
Directions
1. Microwave IMO syrup in a bowl until bubbles start to form 
(about 30 seconds on high).
2. Remove bowl from microwave and add remaining 
ingredients. Combine all the ingredients together with 
a mixer or spoon until you achieve a sticky, doughy 
consistency.
3. Spread mixture onto a silicone tray and transfer to a 
freezer. Pro Tip: To help transfer the gooey mixture, Greg 
recommends that you spray one of your fingers with 
cooking spray to help to evenly distribute across the tray.
4. After about 1 hour in the freezer, remove the tray and let 
sit at room temperature for 5 minutes. Slice the batch into 
portion sizes of choice (for reference on the nutrition by 
portion size, see the nutrition table). Wrap individual pieces 
in wax paper and return them to the freezer.
5. Chocolate bars should remain in the freezer until they are 
ready to be eaten. Eat within 5 minutes of removing from 
the freezer for best results.

Directions
1. Pop popcorn in the microwave per directions. Once popped, 
place the popped popcorn in a larger bowl than last time.

2. Separately, put the IMO syrup in a microwave-safe bowl, and 
microwave for 30 seconds.
3. Add chocolate syrup, protein powder and sweetener to the IMO 
syrup and stir with a spoon. 
4. Pour the syrup/protein powder mixture on top of the popped 
SmartPop, and carefully mix with a spatula until well combined 
NOTE: It can take some work to get the popcorn evenly coated. If 
you don’t mind getting a little messy use your hands!
5. Place and store the chocolate popcorn in the freezer. Eat half now 
and save the rest for later if you can!! (Although you might not be 
able to... these are crazy good!)

Chocolate Protein Ice Cream 
Pudding
Directions
1. Add all ingredients to a blender. Blend for 1 minute on medium-high speed until there is a smooth 
consistency. Note that if you use casein protein, the protein ice cream pudding will be thicker.
2. Scrape sides of the blender and ensure all ingredients are blended. You may have to pulse the blender a 
few times depending on the consistency you want to achieve. You can always add more ice or water to 
get the consistency you desire.
3. Pour the mixture out of the blender and into a bowl to consume immediately. You may drizzle with 
powdered peanut butter, or fresh blueberries, or Walden Farms low-calorie syrup, or popcorn, anything 
that makes it more interesting and delicious for you. IT DOESN’T MATTER! There are NO rules in this 
kitchen! Just be sure that you account for your toppings when tracking your calories.

high speed until there is a smooth consistency. Note that if you 
use casein protein, the shake will be thicker.
2. Scrape sides of the blender and ensure all ingredients are 
blended. You may have to pulse the blender a few times 
depending on the consistency you want to achieve. You can 
always add more ice or almond milk to get the consistency you 
desire.

Chocolate PB Protein Ice 
Cream
Directions
1. Add all ingredients to a blender. Blend for 1 minute on medium-high speed until there is a smooth 
consistency. Note that if you use casein protein, the ice cream will be thicker.
2. Scrape sides of the blender and ensure all ingredients are blended. You may have to pulse the blender a 
few times depending on the consistency you want to achieve. You can always add more ice or water to 
get the consistency you desire.
3. Pour the mixture out of the blender and into a bowl to consume immediately. You may drizzle with 
powdered peanut butter, or fresh blueberries, or Walden Farms low-calorie syrup, or popcorn, anything 
that makes it more interesting and delicious for you. IT DOESN’T MATTER! There are NO rules in this 
kitchen! Just be sure that you account for your toppings when tracking your calories.

Strawberry Protein Ice Cream
Directions
1. Add all ingredients to a blender. Blend for 1 minute on medium-high speed until there is a smooth 
consistency. Note that if you use casein protein, the ice cream will be thicker.
2. Scrape sides of the blender and ensure all ingredients are blended. You may have to pulse the blender a 
few times depending on the consistency you want to achieve. You can always add more ice or water to 
get the consistency you desire.
3. Pour the mixture out of the blender and into a bowl to consume immediately. You may drizzle with 
powdered peanut butter, or fresh blueberries, or Walden Farms low-calorie syrup, or popcorn, anything 
that makes it more interesting and delicious for you.

Chocolate Strawberry Almond Proteinsicles are a delicious frozen, fruity, and chocolatey treat. They are 
EXTREMELY anabolic due to the high protein content relative to everything else (62% of the calories come 
from PROTEIN)! Coach Greg’s entire freezer is stuffed with these because they are delicious, anabolic, and 
amazing!
